What does it do?
----------------

This extension adds an content element based on GPXViewer from Jürgen Berkemeier (https://www.j-berkemeier.de/GPXViewer/) as a plugin.
You may use it to display GPX tracks or GPX waypoints on maps in the frontend.
All settings of GPXViewer are implemented as typoscript constants and can be set up in the backend.
For examples, what you can do with this extension, please also refer to the sample pages on my website:

.. important::

   Please don't forget to repeat your extension's version number in the
   :file:`Settings.yml` file, in the :code:`release` property. It will be
   automatically picked up on the cover page by the :code:`|release|`
   substitution.
